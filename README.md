# House Checkup Project

## Description
Many homeowners struggle with managing their home appliances systematically, often resulting in overlooked maintenance and unexpected breakdowns.

The Consequences of Neglecting Home Appliance Management:

Increased Costs: Emergency repairs and premature appliance replacements can lead to significant financial strain.

Loss of Efficiency: Neglected appliances often consume more energy, driving up utility bills.

There's a clear need for an intuitive, user-friendly platform that simplifies appliance maintenance. HC is designed to meet this need, providing essential tools for:
- Tracking appliance status and maintenance history.
- Scheduling regular maintenance tasks.
- Educating users on proper appliance care and management.
