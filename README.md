# House Checkup Project

## Description

Problem:
Many homeowners lack a systematic approach to managing their home appliances, which often leads to overlooked maintenance and unexpected breakdowns.

Consequences of Neglected Home Appliance Management:

Increased costs due to emergency repairs and premature replacement of appliances.
Loss of efficiency and higher energy consumption, leading to increased utility bills.

Solution:
There is a clear need for an intuitive, accessible platform that makes appliance maintenance manageable and straightforward. HC aims to fill this gap by providing tools for:

Tracking appliance status and maintenance history.
Scheduling regular maintenance tasks.
Educating users on proper appliance care and management.
