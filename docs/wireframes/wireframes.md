## Appliances Page 

This is the primary functional page of the application. Users will be able to add new appliances, update their features, date of last repair and see the due dates of new repairs. The page can scroll down if there are too many appliances on it. This page will also include a menu for users to route to pages they need or desire depending on the pages we decide to implement in the future.
